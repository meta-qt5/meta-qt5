Subject: [PATCH] Fix use of private dependency

With 0761173a, Linux SPI Accessibility bridge was added to
the Wayland QPA plugin, but this had a bad side-effect to
QtWaylandClient.

Linux Accessibility support is a private module, this means we have
to link to it with QT_PRIVATE not QT, otherwise CMake and pkg-config
files for Qt5WaylandClient will depend on it.

Fixes: QTBUG-76042
