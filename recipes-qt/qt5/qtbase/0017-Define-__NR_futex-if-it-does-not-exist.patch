Subject: [PATCH] Define __NR_futex if it does not exist

__NR_futex is not defines by newer architectures e.g. arc, riscv32 as
they only have 64bit variant of time_t. Glibc defines SYS_futex interface based on
__NR_futex, since this is used in applications, such applications start
to fail to build for these newer architectures. This patch defines a
fallback to alias __NR_futex to __NR_futex_tim64 so SYS_futex keeps
working

Upstream-Status: Pending
